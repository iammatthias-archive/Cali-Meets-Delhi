# Cali Meets Delhi

We're getting married in India and in the United States! It's pretty exciting. While planning, we checked out all the tools on the web — The Knot, Wedding Wire, Zola, etc. Each platform promised different things, but we settled on Zola in the end.

Part of why we chose Zola was the fact that they let you embed your registry on another site. I jumped at this idea, because I wanted to be able to build and style something that really •fit• us as a couple. The cookie-cutter WYSISYG editors with limited templates just didn't cut it.
